# js tic-tac-toe

A JavaScript tic-tac-toe app I created-
Try it out [here](https://mattlub.github.io/js-tic-tac-toe/)!

### Motivations
I wanted to make a well-structured js app. It also provides a (super basic) intro to making an
AI, which is always something which has interested me.

### Useful things learnt
I used better, more descriptive variable names, and abstracted away functions so the 
JavaScript reads better. Admittedly, I still could have done more.

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] style better
- [ ] add option to customise size of board (and number of in a row required- would this work?)
- [ ] build back-end which stores computer's success rate

### Collaboration
Any contributions/comments are welcome!
